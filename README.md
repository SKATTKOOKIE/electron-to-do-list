# Electron To Do List

## Dependencies

Node.js

Electron

Electron package manager

## Description

This was just a small hour project so that I could learn how to package simple webpages with electron rather than having to run a page via live server or hosting a PHP page.

The application stores the items in local storage so if you re compile the application you will lose your items.

A future consideration is for it to create a physical JSON file and read and write to that so when you make changes your items will not be lost.
